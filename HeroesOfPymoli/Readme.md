Heroes of Pymoli observable trends based on the data analysis:

1.	After analyzing the data based on gender demographics, we can see that the highest percentage of players were male at 84% versus female players at 14%, and that they constituted 82.7% of the total purchase value.

2.	When factoring the age into our data, we a saw a trend of the highest percentage of players among the age group of 20-24 years, and that same age group had the highest average purchase per person. They had more than double the percentage than the next highest age group of players. In contrast, people over 40 years constituted the lowest age group of players. More than 75% of the players fell between the ages of 15 and 29 years of age. 

3.	Although the 20 to 24 years old group had more total Purchase Value, the average total purchase per person was highest for the 35 to 39 year age group. The item Final Critic had the highest total purchase value and it was most profitable, with Oathbreaker, Last Hope of the Breaking Storm second and the remaining items evenly purchased thereafter. Item price did not appear to have a bearing on the purchase count given Final Critic was the most the expensive. Some of the items in the most profitable list (e.g. Nirvana) were not among the most popular.
